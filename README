git-merge-rename -- Resolve merges by forking the file
======================================================

git-merge-rename is a custom merge strategy, inspired by Dropbox's
conflict-handling, which resolves merges by creating two copies of the
conflicted file, leaving the original copy in place, and copying the
other side's version into a renamed path.

Barring error conditions (e.g. out of disk), merges using this merge
strategy should never fail, which should potentially make it
attractive for introducing new users to git, since they can safely
"git pull" without fear of entering the dreaded (by novices)
conflicted-merge state.
